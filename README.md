 Game Instructions

1.   Roll the Dice:   Press the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and get a number.
2.   Rolling a 1:   If you roll a 1, it will switch to the next player. Otherwise, you can choose to roll the dice again for the same player.
3.   Accumulating Score:   Each roll adds to your score. The more you roll, the higher your score will be, unless you roll a 1.
4.   Holding Your Score:   To save your score, you must hold it. If you roll a 1 before holding, your accumulated score for that turn will be lost.
5.   Winning the Game:   The first player to reach a score of 20 or more wins the game.

Good luck and strategize wisely!
